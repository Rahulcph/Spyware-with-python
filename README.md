Keylogger with Client-Server Communication 🔑📡
This project demonstrates a simple keylogger with client-server communication using Python. The keylogger captures keystrokes on the client machine and sends them to a designated server over a socket connection.

🚨 Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational purposes or use in controlled environments with explicit permission. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations before deploying this script.

📖 Features
Server Listener:
A server script listens for incoming connections and receives key logs from the client.

Keylogger Client:
Captures keystrokes and sends them to the server in real-time.

Socket Communication:
Establishes a TCP connection between the client and the server.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x:

Install Python: Download Python
Dependencies: Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Kopier kode
pip install pynput
Network Configuration:

Ensure both the client and server machines are on the same network or properly configured for communication.
🚀 Usage
1. Server Setup
Run the server script on the receiver machine:

bash
Kopier kode
python server.py
Replace receiver_port with the desired port number in the script. The server will start listening for incoming connections.

2. Client Setup
Run the client script on the target machine:

bash
Kopier kode
python client.py
Replace receiver_ip and receiver_port with the server's IP address and port in the script. The client will connect to the server and start sending key presses.

⚙️ File Structure
server.py:
Script for the server that listens for key logs.

client.py:
Keylogger script that captures and sends keystrokes to the server.

🛡️ Security and Ethics
Legal Compliance:
Ensure you have explicit permission to use this tool on the target machine.

Network Security:
Use a secure network or encryption to avoid interception of sensitive data.

Use Case:
This tool should only be used for authorized purposes, such as monitoring systems in controlled environments or for educational demonstrations.

💡 Example
Server Output:

plaintext
Kopier kode
Waiting for connection...
Connected.
Hello World
The server displays keystrokes received from the client.

Client Activity:
The client captures key presses and sends them to the server in real-time.

✨ Customization
Data Handling:
Modify the on_press function in the client script to process or filter keys as needed.

Encryption:
Implement encryption in the send_data function to secure transmitted data.

🧩 Potential Improvements
Add encryption for secure data transmission.
Log additional metadata such as timestamps.
Enhance error handling for better stability.
